🧠 KMeans Clustering GUI App
This Python project is a GUI-based application for performing clustering analysis on datasets from code.datasciencedojo.com.
It allows users to select a dataset, apply preprocessing, and then cluster the data using the KMeans algorithm. It also generates helpful charts for exploring the data visually.

✅ Features
📁 Select and load datasets from the local system (originally from code.datasciencedojo.com)

⚙️ Preprocess data (handle missing values, scale features, etc.)

📊 Cluster using KMeans algorithm (from scikit-learn)

📈 Display useful charts such as:

Elbow method plot

Cluster visualizations (2D/3D)

Pair plots or distribution plots of features

🔧 Technologies Used
Python

tkinter – GUI design

pandas, numpy – data handling

scikit-learn – machine learning (KMeans)

matplotlib, seaborn – data visualization
